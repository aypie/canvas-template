# HTML5 Canvas Project Template

This is a handy template for setting up anything that requires drawing to a Canvas (using 2D context).

There are two files: `index.html` that sets up HTML5 canvas and correctly sets its size to the screen's width and
height without borders, and `script.js` - a simple script that prepares the `Canvas` object for use.

## Why does this exist?

This is a small template that aims to help those that want to try using Canvas object in JavaScript but
are too lazy to set everything up themselves and want to jump straight in.

## Is this done?

You can use this template right now. The only things left are a short description of what is happening in
`index.html` and `script.js` and a short reference for all main Canvas functions that will be useful for
beginners. If you want to help with that - there are two Git branches you can add to.
