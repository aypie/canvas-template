# HTML5 Canvas Project Template

This is a handy template for setting up anything that requires drawing to a Canvas (using 2D context).

There are two files: `index.html` that sets up HTML5 canvas and correctly sets its size to the screen's width and height without borders, and `script.js` - a simple script that prepares the `Canvas` object for use.
